# Get Bullied

This project contains both a game and a Discord bot to interact with it.

## Requirements

This project has multiple dependencies:
- Python >=3.10 (3.10 & 3.11 tested).
- `discord` and `python-dotenv` python packages.

## Setup

Before starting the bot, multiple steps need to be done in order ton configure it.
### Bot configuration
A `config/` folder needs to be created.
The folder contains the following configuration:
- `admins.txt` containing a list of the bot admins' discord id on each line.

The `env.example` file needs to be renamed `.env` and contain the following fields:
- `DISCORD_TOKEN` your discord bot token.

### Game Configuration
For the moment, no configuration is available.
