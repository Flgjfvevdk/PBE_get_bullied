__Bullies:__
- Check your Bullies with **!!club**.
- Store them in reserve with **!!reserve** (max 10).
- Each Bully has a rarity (NOBODY, TOXIC, MONSTER, DEVASTATOR, SUBLIME) (see **!!tuto_rarity**).
- A Bully's level (lvl) increases when it accumulates as much experience as its level.
- Bullies have stats (Strength, Agility, Lethality, Viciousness) that increase when they gain levels.

__Important points:__
- NOBODY's death is permanent.
- Other Bullies resurrect but lose levels equal to their number of deaths.
- NOBODYs reveal their potential at level 15...
- Fights earn experience and money, depending on the defeated Bully's rarity.
- Bullies that are too strong (5 levels higher than the enemy) don't gain experience, only money.
- Trade your Bullies with **!!trade @user**.
- Abandon a Bully with **!!sacrifice**.
