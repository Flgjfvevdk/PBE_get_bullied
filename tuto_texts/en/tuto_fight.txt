- Statistics define the probability of activating an effect to gain advantage during combat

__Stats:__
- Strength: Compared to opponent's to block an attack.
- Agility: Compared to opponent's to attempt to steal a turn.
- Lethality: Compared to opponent's Strength and Lethality to deal extra damage.
- Viciousness: Compared to opponent's to attempt to decrease their best stat with each attack.

__Comparison:__
- When we say a statistic is compared, it means we have a probability of activating an effect that depends on the ratio between 2 statistics.
- Having a statistic barely better than the one it's compared to greatly increases the chances of winning a comparison.

__ðŸ’¥ Tip:__
- To win a fight, it's better to choose a Bully that has the most different statistics above those of the opponent.
