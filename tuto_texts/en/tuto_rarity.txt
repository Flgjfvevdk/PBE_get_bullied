__Rarity:__
- There are 5 types of rarity: NOBODY < TOXIC < MONSTER < DEVASTATOR < SUBLIME (ordered by power).
- A bully's rarity indicates how its statistics increase with each level.
- A Bully with high rarity gains experience slower and gives more when dying.
- In team combat (against a player, dungeon, ruin, arena), having 3 Bullies with the same rarity grants a Buff to your team.
