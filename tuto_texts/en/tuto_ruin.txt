__Ruins:__
- Command: **!!ruin [level]** (ex: !!ruin 10).
- A ruin is ideal for earning money.
- Each ruin includes a series of rooms that can lead to: a fight, a chest, a trapped room.
- Bullies don't regenerate before the end of ruin exploration.
- During boss fights, the player can swap the fighting Bully whenever they want.
- The final Boss drops a consumable (an elixir or a snack).
- The level of the highest Ruin you've beaten determines your **!!payday** gains.
